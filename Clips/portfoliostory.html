<h3>How I built this portfolio?</h3>

<p>So, basically, trial and error. </p>

<p>I have zero programming experience. Even though I learned how to embed Flourish charts into articles in my previous newsroom, I have no idea what all those lines of code mean. I look at them the way I looked at math in 10th grade: How does this work? Is there a reason for how it works? Do I REALLY need to understand this?</p>

<p>I have always wanted to be an investigative journalist who could tell complicated stories with compelling data. But I have struggled to present the data I find or the idea in my head because I am not able to create the visualization, let alone present it in a web format. </p>

<p>Now that I look at the code I wrote for this portfolio, it is no longer mysterious to me, I understand the purpose of each and every line, and I know what to do if I want to modify or update it. </p>

<p>I can't say that I fully understand how HTML works (I'm still afraid of seeing mistakes.) But I find it really interesting! Frankly, my whole life and career path has been built on finding journalism "interesting".</p>

<p>And I know that feeling will push me to learn more complicated but interesting things in the coding world. This portfolio will be the start.</p>
