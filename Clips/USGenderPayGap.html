<h3>U.S. Gender Pay Gap in 2023</h3>

<p>Gender pay gap in the U.S. reflects the difference between what men and women earn. In 2023, full-time, year-around working women earned 83% of what their male counterparts earned, <a href="https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/2024/demo/p60-282.pdf"><span class="highlight">according</span></a> to the Census Bureau. It has only slightly narrowed over the past 20 years, as women earned 81% as much as men in 2003, according to Pew Research Center's recent <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/03/04/gender-pay-gap-in-us-has-narrowed-slightly-over-2-decades/"></a><span class="highlight">article.</span></a>
</p>

<p>Historically, women faced barriers to education and were steered toward lower-paying jobs. Even today, societal expectations and biases influence career choices, which make women often underrepresented in high-paying fields like STEM and overrepresented in lower-paying roles such as caregiving.</p>
    
<p>Although none of the 50 states achieved gender pay equity in 2023, the map shows that in the top-performing states, Maine and Vermont, women earned 89% of what men earned. At the other end of the spectrum, women in Louisiana earned only 73% of men's.    
</p>
    
<p>Interestingly, some states with relatively low median incomes, such as Arkansas and Mississippi, had a slightly narrower gender pay gap of 84%. This suggests that in regions where economic opportunities are limited for everyone, the gender gap, while still present, may be less severe than in higher income regions.
</p>
    
<h5>Methodology</h5>

<p>I submitted the FOIA requests for the Fall Quarter Investigative Seminar. I requested public records including annual earnings of women and men, and the ratio of annual earnings of women to men by race and ethnicity by state, from 2019 to 2023. The Bureau of Labor Statistics responded in a series of PDF documents with data by state, but not by race or ethnicity.
</p>
    
<p>I didn't write any stories based on these documents last quarter, but I thought it would be great to visualize them now that I've learned how to make maps.</p>
    
<p>As the documents provided are PDFs, I used Tabula to convert the data into an Excel file. The original dataset included the number of employees in each state, income median and standard error. As I was trying to use a shade map to show the difference of gender pay gap between states, I decided to only keep the percentage difference and the income median.</p>
    
<p>The map is shaded based on the percentage of income difference. Map visualizations usually set dark colors for higher values. But in this case, I think it should be set to have darker colors for lower values, which means a larger gender pay gap, as it would help readers understand which states are doing worse. </p>
    
<p>For the popups, I included the median weekly income to give more context to the visualization. For example, Washington (76%) and Virginia (78%) have similar statistics, both being a wealthier state on the west and east coasts.</p>
    
<p>In the notes, I have added the Bureau of Labor Statistics' explanation of the dataset, which actually reflects the shortcomings of this visualization by including only full-time workers.
